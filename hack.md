# Report paper : IOT Internet of Things
## 1. Definition : should be simple enough
- Long
- The Internet of things (IoT) is a **system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines** provided with **unique identifiers** (UIDs)( UID is any identifier which is guaranteed to be unique among all identifiers used for those objects and for a specific purpose) and the ability to **transfer data over a network** **without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction**.
- Some Real-World IOT Examples:
    - *IoT Sensors* :![](https://i.imgur.com/avTjKMg.jpg)
        - IoT sensors consist of manual or digital sensors connected to circuit boards, which can be programmed to measure a range of data collected from a sensor device such as carbon monoxide, temperature, humidity, pressure, vibration, and motion.
        - IoT sensors can not only gather data at different physical environments but also send data to the connected devices.
        - The IoT sensors allow seamless control of data through automation delivering actionable insights



    - *IoT Tracking and Monitoring System*:![](https://i.imgur.com/kkWu646.png)IoT asset tracking devices use GPS or radio frequency (RF) to track and monitor properties. The smart devices can be used for long-range identification and verification of assets.
    - *Smart Farming*:![](https://i.imgur.com/bpVZf6k.png)Farmers can use smart IoT farming applications for optimizing a lot of different activities such as determining the best time to harvest plants, creating fertilizer profiles based on the chemistry of soil, and sensing soil nutrients and moisture levels.



## 2. How IOT works (should be the highlight here)
- Should we stress on framework and standard procedure?
- Tài
## 3. Applications (Pros)
- Quang
## 4. Risk following usage of IOTs. (Cons)
As an IOT system scale up with more connected devices, it is prone to several factors:
-  higher risk of being penetrated by hackers. More devices in the network means more opening for a surface attack.
-  issues collecting and processing ever-enlarging data.
-  A small compromise in a device can lead to the collapse of the whole system.
-   Non-universal standards of devices connectivity and compatibility, making communication harder as the system scale up.

### IOT security: 

IoT security is the protection of Internet of Things devices from attack. While many business owners are aware that they need to protect computers and phones with antivirus, the security risks related to IoT devices are less well known and their protection is too often neglected.
- How can IOT systems be at risk:
    - Access to sensitive data: eg.printer, webcam ,CCTV for gathering secret intelligence that may harm the business.
    - Sabotage: deliberately make harm to your system.
        -    E.g: Wannacry 2017, lock down computers for ransom.
    - Botnets: 
        - an attackers connect multiple hacked IOT devices, e.g: video cameras , to create a network called botnet.
        - can be used for multiple things, especially DDOS ( Distributed Denial of Service):
            - Multiple devices sending streams of network requests to the servers, which overflow servers' response rate and make them crash.
            - Example: 2016 a DDOS att ack brought down Netflix and Spotify.
        - methods: manufacturers leave IOT devices with default password and username without alerting the users. Hackers take advantage on that security loophole and access those devices simply by trying sA programming language's surface form is known as its syntax. Most programming languages are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages. On the other hand, there are some programming languages which are more graphical in nature, using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program. ome popular password combinations.

# Another report paper: Programming languages:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language
## 1. Definition 
- Long
- A programming language is a notation for writing programs, which are specifications of a computation or algorithm. Some authors restrict the term "programming language" to those languages that can express all possible algorithms. Traits often considered important for what constitutes a programming language include:
    - ***Function and target***:
        - A *computer programming language* is a language used to write **computer programs**, which involves a computer **performing some kind of computation** or **algorithm and possibly control external devices** such as printers, disk drives, robots, and so on.
        - A complete specification for a *programming language* includes a **description, possibly idealized, of a machine or processor** for that language
        - *Programming languages*  allow humans to communicate instructions to machines.
    - ***Abstractions***
        - *Programming languages* usually contain abstractions for **defining** and **manipulating data structures** or **controlling the flow of execution**.  
    - **Expressive power**
    - 
## 2.History of Programming language :/ 
- Tài
- Machine language
- High-level language (should come with an example)
- Low-level language
- Interpreter
- Compiler
## 3. Component 
- Syntax: grammar of a programming language.
    - Textual: use sequences of text : words , numbers, punctuation much like written natural language. E.g: python, C, Java,... most of the programming languages .
    - Graphical: use visual cues: picture, graph, lines to represent a program. E.g: Scratch.
    Syntactical errors can be spotted by compiler or interpreter at compile time.
    E.g: in MATLAB:
    
- Semantics
    - 
- Type system
- Standard library
- Runtime system
